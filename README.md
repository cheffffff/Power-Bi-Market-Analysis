# Power-Bi-Market-Analysis
Here I'm improving my skills with Power BI, by transforming the dataset into a more useable structure, aggregating Relationship status alongside with campaign they joined. 

I delve into how successful each marketing campaign is based on how much money was spent alongside how many complaint there were with the business. I also looked at what customers would spend their money on and how they would purchase it based off multiple factors, including their relationship status, their edcucation level and how many children they have.

Finally I looked into their income. Specifically how much they'd spend and how many children they would have based on their income, as well as seeing how much income they made based on their education / relationship status.

The dataset used for this was from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data/data
